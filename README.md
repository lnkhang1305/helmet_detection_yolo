# Helmet Dectection 
This project is using YOLOv10 to detect helmet in image. In this repo, you can train or test the model trained with COCO dataset. I use Google Colab to train and test model
## Test model
You just run the cell of Test section to test the model that I have trained. You can upload your image to be the input of model
